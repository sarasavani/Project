About:

This program uses f1 data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020) to make three types of analysis:
- Graphs that (for a given GP) compare the times for lap of up to 4 drivers
- Statistics about up to 4 drivers for a given GP (fastest and slowest lap and in which lap, best and worst postitions and in which lap, starting and finishing positions, positions gained or lost,
total time and medium pace)
- Graph that depicts the variations of positions of drivers in a selected GP

This was done using Phyton and the libraries pandas, matplotlib and numpy
